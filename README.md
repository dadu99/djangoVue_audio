# djangoVue_audio

This is a simple web page that combines the two frameworks for working together to request the prediction of already trained models. Because the models and all the pre-processing of data were made with python, we thought that the best option to do this is Django. It is free and has 
a lot of documentation available which makes it easy to be learnt and also, has as base MVT architecture. We choose this framework because is the most versatile framework used to build basically any kind of website and helps developers minimize many typical security blunders by 
offering a framework designed for " doing the right things" to automatically protecting the website.
Also, is compatible with any client-side framework and can transmit material in virtually any format for example: HTML, JSON, and XML).
